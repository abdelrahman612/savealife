Patients who need blood are facing a lot of difficulties to find their group of blood in an appropriate time. As a result, they need to search in all the blood banks or hospitals in a trial to reach the needed blood type. Unfortunately, they may not find their group of blood at the end. In this case, they would need to announce on the social media, mosques and churches for the needed blood type. For saving life, we propose a mobile application that enables the user to sign up with all his information such as: the name, the id, the phone number, the email address and the group of blood. Our application enables the patient to ask for the quantity and the group of blood he needs and he can determine the address that he wants to receipt the blood in. This application sends an email, phone call or a notification from the application itself to the Blood Donator. The donator sign up in our database that has the wanted group of blood with the way they prefer from the details they left in our database. Afterwards, a a confirmation message is sent to the donator to confirm his ability to donate.

Our application facilitates the communication between the patients and the Blood Donators. It provides a search by the userâ€™s location that will be detected by GPS sensor and then, it will give the user the nearest Blood Donator with the most suitable group of blood. The proposed application is implemented in Android, Kotlin and based on recent technologies such as Google Firebase.
